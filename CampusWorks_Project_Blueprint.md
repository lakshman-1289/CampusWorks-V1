# CampusWorks - Complete Project Blueprint
## Peer-to-Peer Academic Record Outsourcing Platform

---

## üéØ Project Overview

**CampusWorks** is a platform where students can post offline record/assignment tasks they need help with, along with a budget. Other students can view these tasks, place bids within a limited time window, and the lowest bidder gets assigned. The assigned student completes the work offline, notifies completion, the task owner verifies offline and accepts online, then payment is processed.

**üéØ KEY POINT: Single Role System**
- **All users are STUDENTs by default** (except one admin)
- **Same person can both post tasks AND bid on tasks**
- **No complex role management needed**
- **Simpler, more flexible, and more realistic**

### Core Workflow:
1. **Student posts task** with budget and requirements
2. **Other students bid** on tasks within time window
3. **Lowest bidder wins** and gets assigned
4. **Assigned student completes work** offline and notifies completion
5. **Task owner verifies work** offline and accepts online
6. **Payment processed** through escrow system
7. **Chat communication** for task clarification

**üí° Note**: The same person can be both a task poster AND a task bidder - they're all students!

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

### Microservices Architecture with API Gateway Pattern
- **Eureka Server** - Service Discovery & Registration
- **API Gateway** - Centralized routing, JWT validation, CORS
- **Auth Service** - User authentication, authorization, role management
- **Task Service** - Task CRUD operations, status management
- **Bidding Service** - Bid management, auction logic
- **Payment Service** - Escrow system, payment processing
- **Notification Service** - Real-time notifications, messaging
- **Profile Service** - User profile management
- **Chat Service** - Real-time communication between users

---

## üîê Security & Authentication Strategy

### JWT-Based Security via API Gateway
- **Single JWT validation** at API Gateway level
- **No JWT handling** in downstream services
- **Role-based access control** using Spring Security
- **CORS configured globally** at API Gateway only

### Role Management (Simplified & Secure) - APPROACH A RECOMMENDED ‚úÖ

**Why This Approach?**
- **Simpler**: No complex role promotion system needed
- **Flexible**: Same person can both post tasks AND bid on tasks
- **Secure**: Only one admin, no self-promotion to admin
- **Realistic**: Matches how students actually work in real life

**How It Works:**
- **Only ONE ADMIN** - created automatically on startup
- **All new registrations default to STUDENT**
- **STUDENT role is flexible** - same person can:
  - Post tasks (as a student needing help)
  - Bid on others' tasks (as a student helping others)
- **No complex role management needed**
- **Business logic determines context**:
  - If posting task ‚Üí acting as STUDENT needing help
  - If bidding on task ‚Üí acting as STUDENT helping others
  - But still same role: STUDENT

**Example User Journey:**
1. **John registers** ‚Üí Gets STUDENT role
2. **John posts a task** ‚Üí "I need help with math assignment"
3. **John bids on Mary's task** ‚Üí "I can help with English essay"
4. **John can do both** ‚Üí Same role, different contexts

- **Structured Logging**: Consistent format across services
- **Request Tracking**: Unique request IDs for tracing
- **Error Logging**: Detailed error information with stack traces
- **Performance Logging**: Request/response time tracking

### Log Format
```
[Timestamp] [Service] [Level] [RequestId] [User] [Message] [Context]
```

### Log Categories
- **Authentication**: Login, logout, registration attempts
- **Business Logic**: Task creation, bidding, payment processing
- **Security**: Authorization failures, validation errors
- **Performance**: Slow queries, timeouts
- **Integration**: Service-to-service communication

---

## üîí Security Implementation

### JWT Token Structure
```json
{
  "sub": "user_id",
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "roles": "STUDENT",
  "iat": "issued_at_timestamp",
  "exp": "expiration_timestamp"
}
```

### Role-Based Access Control (Simplified)
- **@PreAuthorize("hasRole('ADMIN')")** - Admin-only endpoints
- **@PreAuthorize("hasRole('STUDENT')")** - Student-only endpoints (can do everything)
- **@PreAuthorize("hasAnyRole('STUDENT', 'ADMIN')")** - Student and Admin access
- **No WORKER role needed** - STUDENTs can naturally act as workers

### Security Headers Propagation
API Gateway adds these headers to downstream services:
- `X-User-Id`: User's unique identifier
- `X-User-Email`: User's email address
- `X-User-Roles`: User's role(s)

**Why These Headers?**
- **Downstream services don't need to parse JWT again**
- **User context is automatically available**
- **Services can use `@RequestHeader("X-User-Id")` to get user info**
- **No need to re-validate JWT in each service**
- **Consistent user context across all microservices**

**How to Use in Postman:**
- **Only need to set**: `Authorization: Bearer <your-jwt-token>`
- **API Gateway automatically adds**: `X-User-Id`, `X-User-Email`, `X-User-Roles`
- **You don't manually set these headers** - they're added automatically

**How to Use in Code:**
```java
@GetMapping("/my-tasks")
public List<Task> getMyTasks(@RequestHeader("X-User-Id") Long userId) {
    // userId is automatically extracted from JWT by API Gateway
    return taskService.findByOwnerId(userId);
}
```

---

## üåê CORS Configuration

### Global CORS at API Gateway
- **Allowed Origin Patterns**: All origins (`*`) for development
- **Allowed Methods**: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS
- **Allowed Headers**: All headers (`*`)
- **Credentials**: Enabled for authentication
- **Max Age**: 1 hour cache for preflight requests

**Note**: Uses `allowed-origin-patterns` instead of `allowed-origins` for compatibility with credentials

### No CORS Configuration in Individual Services
- CORS handled centrally at API Gateway
- Downstream services focus on business logic
- Consistent CORS behavior across all endpoints

---

## üìä Health Monitoring

### Actuator Endpoints
- **Health Checks**: `/actuator/health`
- **Info**: `/actuator/info`
- **Metrics**: `/actuator/metrics` (future)
- **Custom Health**: Service-specific health indicators

### Health Check Strategy
- **Database connectivity** - Verify database connections
- **Service dependencies** - Check inter-service communication
- **Resource availability** - Memory, disk space monitoring
- **Custom business logic** - Service-specific health criteria

---

## üß™ Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- **Service layer** - Business logic validation
- **Repository layer** - Data access testing
- **Controller layer** - API endpoint testing
- **Security layer** - Authentication/authorization testing

### Integration Testing

spring.cloud.gateway.routes[0].predicates[0]=Path=/api/auth/**

spring.cloud.gateway.routes[1].id=auth-service-direct  
spring.cloud.gateway.routes[1].predicates[0]=Path=/auth/**

# Fixed CORS configuration:
spring.cloud.gateway.globalcors.cors-configurations.[/**].allowed-origin-patterns=*
spring.cloud.gateway.globalcors.cors-configurations.[/**].allow-credentials=true
```

## üéØ Final Implementation Summary

### What We're Building
**CampusWorks** - A peer-to-peer academic task outsourcing platform where:
- **All users are STUDENTs by default** (except one admin)
- **Same person can both post tasks AND bid on tasks**
- **No complex role management needed**
- **JWT security handled only at API Gateway**
- **Microservices architecture for scalability**

### Key Benefits of This Approach
‚úÖ **Simpler**: No complex role promotion system  
‚úÖ **Flexible**: Users can naturally switch between task poster and task bidder  
‚úÖ **Secure**: Only one admin, no self-promotion to admin  
‚úÖ **Realistic**: Matches how students actually work in real life  
‚úÖ **Maintainable**: Clean separation of concerns  

### What You Need to Remember
1. **Only set `Authorization: Bearer <jwt>` in Postman** - other headers are automatic
2. **All new users get STUDENT role by default**
3. **STUDENTs can do everything** - post tasks, bid on tasks, etc.
4. **API Gateway handles all JWT validation** - services just use the headers
5. **No WORKER role needed** - it's all handled by business logic

---

This blueprint provides a comprehensive roadmap for implementing CampusWorks from scratch. Each service has clear responsibilities, the security model is well-defined, and the implementation phases are structured for incremental development. The focus on microservices with centralized security via API Gateway ensures maintainability and scalability while keeping the system secure and performant.
